## Introduction

This project leverages randomly generated data, which constitutes a pivotal aspect of its execution. The rationale behind this approach stems from the unavailability of the specific dataset required for the project. Despite extensive efforts in searching for the requisite data, it became evident that creating our dataset was the most viable solution.

It is imperative to ensure that the generated data doesn't overshadow the core objectives of this project. The primary goal is to deepen our understanding of data engineering fundamentals and gain proficiency in utilizing various tools integral to the project's execution.

Moreover, I welcome any advice on optimizing this project, adhering to best practices, enhancing code quality, and selecting appropriate tools. Collaboration is another key facet, as I will be working alongside two friends who are student analysts, providing an opportunity to experience collaborative project work.

As the project unfolds, regular updates will be made, and additional information will be furnished.

## Project Overview

This project aims to establish a data pipeline for a shopping mall, facilitating the seamless transfer of daily sales records from an OLTP database to an OLAP data warehouse for analytical purposes. The dataset for this endeavor will be simulated using a Python script, mirroring real-world shopping mall sales data as closely as possible.

## Objectives

- Create a data pipeline for transferring daily sales records from an OLTP database to an OLAP data warehouse.
- Generate simulated sales data using a Python script to mimic real-world shopping mall sales.
- Deepen understanding of data engineering fundamentals.
- Gain proficiency in using various tools for data engineering and analytics.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the required dependencies and environment.
3. Execute the Python script for generating simulated sales data.
4. Follow the documentation for setting up the data pipeline and analytics.
