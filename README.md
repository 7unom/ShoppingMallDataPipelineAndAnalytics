# Introduction

This project aims to help a retail business gain valuable insights from its transaction data. By transforming raw data into meaningful metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), we provide the foundation for data-driven decision-making. The project utilizes AWS Redshift as the central data warehouse and AWS Glue for data integration.

As the project unfolds, regular updates will be made, and additional information will be furnished.

**Project Objectives**

Our primary goal in this project is to empower the retail business to gain actionable insights from its vast repository of transaction data. To achieve this, we are working to:

1. Transform transaction data into meaningful metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
2. Establish AWS Redshift as the central data warehouse, serving as the source of truth for all business data.
3. Implement AWS Glue as the integration platform to seamlessly manage data ingestion and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

By achieving these objectives, our aim is to not only enable the business to gain insights into its daily operations but also to establish a scalable and adaptable data infrastructure that will support its growth and evolving analytical needs in the future.

## Project Overview

This project aims to establish a data pipeline for a shopping mall, facilitating the seamless transfer of daily sales records from a spread sheet to a  data warehouse for analytical purposes. The dataset for this endeavor will be simulated using a Python script, mirroring real-world shopping mall sales data as closely as possible.

In this project, we are assisting a retail shopping mall in transitioning from storing their transaction data in spreadsheets to utilizing a data warehouse. This shift enables them to leverage the power of big data and analytics for making data-driven decisions, gaining a deeper understanding of their operations, and facilitating streamlined reporting processes.

## Data Sources and Collection

The data is sourced from the company's point-of-sale systems, capturing transaction details, sales, and customer interactions. However, the data was scripted using Python to generate this data. The script for this [HistoricalTransactionGenerator.py](HistoricalTransactionGenerator.py) can be found in the project repository.
